# ShipSG: Ship Segmentation and Georeferencing Dataset

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15000157.svg)](https://zenodo.org/records/15000157)

The **ShipSG dataset** is the first public dataset of its kind for **ship segmentation and georeferencing**. It is designed for the **development and evaluation** of **instance segmentation and georeferencing methods** using computer vision and deep learning, contributing to the research field of **ship recognition for maritime situational awareness**.

ShipSG consists of:
- **3,505 images** of a port location captured with two different cameras (static and oblique views).
- **11,625 manually annotated ship masks**, categorized into **seven ship classes**.
- **Geographic annotations** (latitude and longitude) for one ship per image.
